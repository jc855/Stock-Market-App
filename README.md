# Interactive data visualization using Shiny App in R
In this project, I created a personal finance dashboard entirely in R and using mainly the Shiny package.
PhantomJS in conjunction with rvest were used to scrape javascript rendered financial data. 
Quantmod package was used as an easy way of pulling near-real-time stock data.

This Shiny application can receive user-input from the client web browser. The server controls the processing of user‐input to display output to the user‐interface.
This app was deployed to shinyapps.io, a platform as a service (PaaS) for hosting Shiny web apps.
